# Lost Shores

Lost shores is a fun little hobby project I'm messing around with. It's a very basic procedural map generator inspired by Dwarf Fortress. I am going to be experimenting with procedural generation and some other things. The game/project is currently in development, its super basic but in the interest of "working in public", here it is.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
